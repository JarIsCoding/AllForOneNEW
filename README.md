Peer Review -  Everything look well placed. I love the colors you used and the look of your submit button. Your input boxes could use some styling :)
I like how you added an arrow to go to the next endpoint and your back sent you back home. But I would also like a button to go to the previous endpoint.
For Mobile the bottom arrows aren't even on some of the pages
For the landing page I like how you put all the endpoints on the right so you can instanly go to the endpoint. BUT one thing I would've like is for the mobile version you would've kept the ability to switch to any endpoint instead of clicking the next arrows. It's hard to navigate through all the endpoints especially if you click the arrow too many times. 
For the mad lib, I believe you're supposed to have 10 inputs instead of 5, but I'm not sure for this assignment. 
For Mobile some of the title texts are hugging the side of the screens. I would add some padding or margin to push it in a little. 
All end points are working correctly. 
Goodjob! keep up the great work!
